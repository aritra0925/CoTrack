Covid-19 Tracking and Community Collaboration App

**Project name:**  
CoTracker- Unique community collaboration Solutions

**Short description:**  
Connecting citizens on health services options to combat COVID 19

**Long description:**  
Covid 19 has not only challenged our existing health infrastructure, it has also laid bare the need for a more efficient information and resource sharing among the communities and stakeholders to combat the pandemic. This pandemic is like no other and while there is a positive inclination among communities towards giving back to the society, these efforts need to be coordinated more sharply to have a more significant impact.
So, while it is imperative that we sharpen our awareness on various health solutions, services and information available in public domain, there is also a need for community collaboration. Though most of the information is available digitally, what is lacking yet is the existence of digital platform that can pool together all the resources available – Communities, Health institutions, Health services and the Govt.
There are a number of portals available in public domain but there are very few solutions which can aim at providing or supporting all of the above-mentioned requirements on a single platform.
What is required is a one stop shop for information, services and collaboration. These include interactive chat bots to provide information, various health services like doctor’s appointment, medicine stores and pathology labs in your locality and even allow Health Institutions to register on this platform for users to avail their services.
CoTracker is an android native application that will enable citizens to connect with all essential health services in the fight against COVID 19 or any other medical complaints. This application is aimed at removing physical fences resulting in the speed of access and delivery of services to the community.
The application is easy to navigate and very user friendly. One can avail various health services options in their locality or anywhere else for that matter. It allows for information sharing among communities and enables the user to access the most relevant information and service options available.
Among other information, it provides a summary view of the status of the pandemic across the country and even globally. This includes total confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths. There is a map that provides an overview of the situation in any country in the world based on your location. One can click on the map to get a better insight into the state or country they’re living in. For India, the website shows a graphical representation of the cases confirmed in every state along with age demographics. It also shows the distance between the user and the nearest COVID 19 confirmed case.
This solution has been developed using Android studio, JAVA, IBM Watson Service, NoSQL Database Cloudant Services from IBM, Google Map, Covid 19 APIs.
