CoTracker- Unique community collaboration Solutions  

**Short description:**
    
Digital collaboration of health-services with larger communities to beat pandemic

**Long description:**  
  
Covid 19 has not only challenged our existing health infrastructure, it has also laid bare the need for a more efficient information and resource sharing among the communities and stakeholders to combat the pandemic. This pandemic is like no other and while there is a positive inclination among communities towards giving back to the society, these efforts need to be coordinated more sharply to have a more significant impact.
So, while it is imperative that we sharpen our awareness on various health solutions, services and information available in public domain, there is also a need for community collaboration. Though most of the information is available digitally, what is lacking yet is the existence of digital platform that can pool together all the resources available – Communities, Health institutions, Health services and the Govt.
There are a number of portals available in public domain but there are very few solutions which can aim at providing or supporting all of the above-mentioned requirements on a single platform.
What is required is a one stop shop for information, services and collaboration. These include interactive chat bots to provide information, various health services like doctor’s appointment, medicine stores and pathology labs in your locality and even allow Health Institutions to register on this platform for users to avail their services. 
CoTracker is an android native application that will enable citizens to connect with all essential health services in the fight against COVID 19 or any other medical complaints. This application is aimed at removing physical fences resulting in the speed of access and delivery of services to the community. 
The application is easy to navigate and very user friendly. One can avail various health services options in their locality or anywhere else for that matter. It allows for information sharing among communities and enables the user to access the most relevant information and service options available. 
Among other information, it provides a summary view of the status of the pandemic across the country and even globally. This includes total confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths. There is a map that provides an overview of the situation in any country in the world based on your location. One can click on the map to get a better insight into the state or country they’re living in. For India, the website shows a graphical representation of the cases confirmed in every state along with age demographics. It also shows the distance between the user and the nearest COVID 19 confirmed case. 
This solution has been developed using Android studio, JAVA, IBM Watson Service, NoSQL Database Cloudant Services from IBM, Google Map, Covid 19 APIs.

It also provides avenues to the doctors, hospitals, health institutions to extend their services in the digitized platform.
The below pictures gives a bird eye view of various readily available services which were developed as part of the hackathon event and the planned future enhancement.

**Way Ahead** 
* Payment Gateway integration
* Develop the application for iOS user
* Community chat
* Testimonials/Videos/Experience sharing of recovered patients, doctors etc.
* Plasma blood bank
* Gateway for donations to Covid cause thru Govt agencies/registered NGOs etc.
* E-Commerce – online medicine supply ( both retail & bulk)

**Services Used**  
This application is built using artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions offered by IBM - Watson Studio for chatbot conversion. 
Also, the solution is built using IBM’s NOSQL database Cloudant to ensure unstructured data is stored securely and easily.  
Apart from that Google Map SDK has enabled location based services to ensure each citizen is aware and informed anytime and anywhere. It has also used Covid 19 APIs as well.
